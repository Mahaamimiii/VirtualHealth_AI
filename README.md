Description:
Developed a virtual health assistant chatbot that interacts with users, understands symptoms, and provides AI-driven health suggestions. Integrated Azure QnA Maker and LUIS for language understanding and real-time triage support.
- Rural and underserved areas have very less access to instant doctor advice. Hence, VirtualHealthAI sserves as a companion to seek medical advice in cases of emergency.
- The user inputs the symptoms and Azure Cognitive Service analyses the medical textual terms and provide predictions of all possible health concerns.
- The chatbot helps in suggesting medicine, healthcare and remedies and converts the diagnosis into a clean dashboard using PowerBI.
- At the end of the day, it suggests to visit doctor nearby.
